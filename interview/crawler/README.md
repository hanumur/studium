We'd like you to write a simple web crawler, in whatever language you're most
comfortable in. It should be limited to one domain - so when crawling it would
crawl all pages within the domain, but not follow the links to our Facebook
and Twitter accounts. Given a URL, it should output a site map, showing which
static assets each page depends on.
