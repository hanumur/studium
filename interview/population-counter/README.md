### Population CountWrite a function which takes a non-negative integer and returns the numberof “1” bits set in the binary representation of that integer.For example, 5 is ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼101 in binary, so population_count(5) should return 2.Here are some other examples:    population_count(0) = 0    population_count(8) = 1    population_count(15) = 4    population_count(19) = 3Your finished program should include both your population_count function andcode to check each of these examples and print the results.Don’t worry about programming “defensively”! The input will always be a nonnegative number less than 1000000 - we don’t care how your program behavesfaced with other inputs.
